<p class="textbook-sect">Japan (juh• PAN) is a chain of islands that  stretches north to south in the northern  Pacific Ocean. Japan islands number more  than 3,000, and many of them are tiny. For  centuries, most Japanese have lived on the  four largest islands: Hokkaido (hah • KY •  doh), Honshu (HAHN•shoo), Shikoku (shih•  KOH• koo), and Kyushu (kee •OO•shoo).  Like China, much of Japan is covered by  mountains. In fact, the islands of Japan are  actually the tops of mountains that rise  from the floor of the ocean. About 188 of  Japan mountains are volcanoes. Many  earthquakes occur in Japan because the  islands lie in an area where parts of the  earth surface often shift.  Because of Japan mountains, only  about 20 percent of its land can be farmed.  Throughout Japan history, local armies  often fought over the few patches of fertile farmland. Just as in ancient Greece, the rugged terrain forced many Japanese to turn to the sea for a living. Early on, they settled in villages along the coast and fished for food. Fish and seafood are  still important in the Japanese diet.
The sea surrounding Japan’s islands made it easy for people in ships to travel along the coast and from island to island. It encouraged people to become merchants, traveling from village to village with goods to trade. The vast ocean around Japan’s islands, however, kept the Japanese people isolated, or separate, from the rest of Asia. As a result, Japan developed its own fiercely independent society with its own religion, art, literature, and government.</p>
