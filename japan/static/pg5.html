<p class="textbook-sect">The Japanese archipelago is over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) long in a north-to-southwardly direction from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean.[7] It is narrow since no point in Japan is more than 150 km (93 mi) from the sea. There are 6,852 islands in total (2007). The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The 6,847 smaller islands are called 'remote islands'.[8][9] This includes the Nansei Islands, the Nanpō Islands and islets, with 430 inhabited islands and others are uninhabited. In total, as of 2018, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi), of which 364,545.24 km2 (140,751.70 sq mi) is land and 13,430 km2 (5,190 sq mi) water.[1] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km (18,486 mi)). It is the largest island country in East Asia and fourth largest island country in the world.[10] There are a wide range of climatic zones and ecosystems.<br/>

Due to Japan's many far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine life and mineral resources in the ocean. The Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan covers 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi) and is the eighth largest in the world. It is more than 11 times the land area of the country.[11]<br/>

Japan has a population of 126 million in 2019.[18] It is the eleventh most populous country in the world and second most populous island country. 81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands.<br/></p>
